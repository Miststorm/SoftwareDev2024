1. I need to get the user's choice between rock, paper, and scissors. My prompt will say "This is rock paper scissors. Enter a number to play. 0 is scissors, 1 is rock, and 2 is paper."


2. I'm displaying to the user a prompt to ask them for input and I'm also showing the user the result of the rock paper scissors game between them and the computer.


3. I will need to do a little math. First I need to check if the computer has picked the same number as the user. If so, it's a tie. Then I check if the user's input is one less than the computer's. If so, the user loses. If not, I check if it's 2 less than the computer's. If so, the user wins. I then check it the other way around, and see if the user's input is one more than the computer. If so, the user wins. If the user's input is 2 more than the computer's, the user loses.


4. I will need 2 variables. The variable for the user's input, and the variable for the computer's choice. These data types will both be integers.
